## Introduction

In this project, we explore various machine learning techniques with the aim of providing insights into how different algorithms perform on datasets. WEKA is the primary tool used for this exploration, offering a GUI and command-line interface to apply machine learning algorithms to data, visualize results, and make decisions based on the analysis.

The core focus is on:
- Decision Trees for classification tasks.
- Classification Rules to derive meaningful patterns from data.
- Clustering algorithms to group data into distinct categories based on similarity.

Each experiment is documented with detailed results in the respective PDF files.

## Machine Learning Algorithms

### 1. Decision Trees
The Decision Tree algorithm is a powerful classification technique used to predict the class or label of an instance by mapping the features of the instance. The structure of the tree represents decision rules learned from the training data.

- **File**: `BE1_decision_trees.pdf`
- **Description**: This document explains the steps and results of using Decision Trees in WEKA, including the tree structure, accuracy metrics, and confusion matrices.

### 2. Classification Rules
Classification rules describe data patterns as a set of "if-then" statements. These rules are typically easier to interpret than other methods like neural networks.

- **File**: `BE2_classification_rules.pdf`
- **Description**: This document contains the results and insights from applying classification rule-based algorithms, showcasing precision, recall, and rule comprehensibility.

### 3. Clustering
Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique used to group similar data points together. Unlike classification, the goal here is to discover hidden patterns or groupings in the data without prior knowledge of class labels.

- **File**: `BE3_clustring.pdf`
- **Description**: This PDF presents the outcomes of various clustering algorithms such as k-means and hierarchical clustering, discussing cluster validity and quality.

## WEKA Software

WEKA (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis) is a collection of machine learning algorithms for data mining tasks. It contains tools for data preprocessing, classification, regression, clustering, association rules, and visualization.

- **Homepage**: [WEKA Official Website](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/)
- **Key Features**:
  - Easy-to-use graphical interface.
  - A wide range of machine learning algorithms.
  - Supports multiple data formats (CSV, ARFF, etc.).
